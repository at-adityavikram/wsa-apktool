# wsa-apktool
creates a batch file that uses adb to auto-install apks into the Windows Subsystem for Android.
use an app like filetypesman or ftypes to  set the generated batch file as the default program to open apk files
In the meantime, im gonna try to figure out a way to register the apk extension to this batch script that needs to work around the UserChoice hash restriction
